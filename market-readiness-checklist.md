### ❌ Critical Issues Blocking Market Launch

#### 1. Audio Engine Not Functional (HIGH PRIORITY)
**Problem**: MPC Studio only generates oscillator sounds, no real audio playback
**Impact**: Core beat-making functionality broken
**Fix Required**: Implement proper audio buffer loading and playback

#### 2. Database Not Connected (HIGH PRIORITY)
**Problem**: Still using memory storage instead of PostgreSQL
**Impact**: Data not persisted, no scalability
**Fix Required**: Switch to DatabaseStorage implementation

#### 3. File Upload System Incomplete (HIGH PRIORITY)
**Problem**: Audio files can't be uploaded or processed
**Impact**: Users can't import their own samples
**Fix Required**: Complete multer integration and file processing

#### 4. Missing Authentication System (MEDIUM PRIORITY)
**Problem**: Demo accounts only, no real user registration
**Impact**: Can't onboard paying customers
**Fix Required**: Implement proper user auth with registration/login

#### 5. No Payment Integration (MEDIUM PRIORITY)
**Problem**: No way to collect subscription payments
**Impact**: Can't monetize the platform
**Fix Required**: Integrate Stripe or similar payment processor

## Essential Fixes for Market Launch

### Phase 1: Core Audio Functionality (Week 1)

#### Fix 1: Real Audio Engine Implementation
```typescript
// Enhanced audio engine with proper sample loading
class AudioEngine {
  private audioContext: AudioContext;
  private sampleBuffers: Map<string, AudioBuffer>;
  
  async loadSample(url: string): Promise<AudioBuffer> {
    const response = await fetch(url);
    const arrayBuffer = await response.arrayBuffer();
    return await this.audioContext.decodeAudioData(arrayBuffer);
  }
  
  playSample(buffer: AudioBuffer, velocity: number = 1.0) {
    const source = this.audioContext.createBufferSource();
    const gainNode = this.audioContext.createGain();
    
    source.buffer = buffer;
    gainNode.gain.value = velocity;
    
    source.connect(gainNode);
    gainNode.connect(this.audioContext.destination);
    source.start();
  }
}
```

#### Fix 2: Database Connection
```typescript
// Replace MemStorage with DatabaseStorage
export class DatabaseStorage implements IStorage {
  async getProject(id: number): Promise<Project | undefined> {
    const [project] = await db.select().from(projects).where(eq(projects.id, id));
    return project;
  }
  
  async createProject(insertProject: InsertProject): Promise<Project> {
    const [project] = await db.insert(projects).values(insertProject).returning();
    return project;
  }
  // ... implement all interface methods
}
```

#### Fix 3: File Upload Processing
```typescript
// Complete file upload with metadata extraction
app.post('/api/upload-audio', upload.single('audio'), async (req, res) => {
  const audioBuffer = fs.readFileSync(req.file.path);
  const metadata = await extractAudioMetadata(audioBuffer);
  
  const audioFile = await storage.createAudioFile({
    name: req.file.originalname,
    size: req.file.size,
    duration: metadata.duration,
    bpm: metadata.bpm,
    key: metadata.key,
    filePath: req.file.path
  });
  
  res.json(audioFile);
});
```

### Phase 2: User Management & Auth (Week 2)

#### Fix 4: User Registration System
```typescript
// User registration and authentication
app.post('/api/auth/register', async (req, res) => {
  const { email, password, userType, name } = req.body;
  
  // Hash password
  const hashedPassword = await bcrypt.hash(password, 10);
  
  // Create user based on type
  if (userType === 'teacher') {
    const teacher = await storage.createTeacher({
      email, password: hashedPassword, name
    });
    res.json({ user: teacher, token: generateJWT(teacher.id) });
  } else {
    const student = await storage.createStudent({
      email, password: hashedPassword, name
    });
    res.json({ user: student, token: generateJWT(student.id) });
  }
});
```

### Phase 3: Payment Integration (Week 3)

#### Fix 5: Stripe Payment Processing
```typescript
// Subscription management with Stripe
app.post('/api/subscriptions/create', authenticateUser, async (req, res) => {
  const { priceId, schoolInfo } = req.body;
  
  const session = await stripe.checkout.sessions.create({
    mode: 'subscription',
    payment_method_types: ['card'],
    line_items: [{
      price: priceId,
      quantity: 1,
    }],
    success_url: `${process.env.DOMAIN}/dashboard?session_id={CHECKOUT_SESSION_ID}`,
    cancel_url: `${process.env.DOMAIN}/pricing`,
    metadata: {
      userId: req.user.id,
      userType: req.user.type
    }
  });
  
  res.json({ sessionId: session.id });
});
```
